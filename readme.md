# Solution Notes

This is a simple reactjs project, using typescript, with vite as the bundler. I brought this code in from a more complex project, so there are likely unnecessary packages/pieces left over.

## Docker

To build docker container (obviously have docker installed) and then from root path: `bash .docker/build.sh`.

To run: `bash run-in-docker.sh`

Open `http://localhost:3000`

# Github Actions

I brought in code in case there is interest to show the ci/cd pipeline works. I haven't tested in this project, but happy to answer questions/help if asked.
